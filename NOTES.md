Hi!
In this small project you can load some mock data (a few and lots of items), filter, sort and paginate them, and see users' details when clicking on the table row.

I have used router here, but there is only one page.
Ideally, a standalone page for users' details can be created, and its router added if there is an API for getting their details by ID.

You can see 'components' folders in src folder and on page level. In src those are components that can be shared, like loader. On page level those are the components used on that page only.
There is a space for improvement, e.g., button can be transformed into reusable and customizable component.

I haven't worked on responsiveness, so UI also needs improvements.
